                                                        <strong>BEFOREHAND:</strong> I'll receive a copy of the estimate form from you, and make a rough, minimum-hour estimate. I'll then ask you to proceed to complete a pre-payment (1/2 of the estimate). Following that, I'll do as much research into your business market, your brand and your customers as I can with the information provided. I will come up with some good search-friendly domain names and provide you with associated costs.
                                                        At the point when we reach 25, 50 and 75 hours of work, you will also be asked to fulfill the remaining balance. This is a standard industry practice and a measure of trust between you (as the client) and me as a designer/developer.

                                                        <strong>WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT:</strong> In case you have not provided me with any details on your business, now will be the time to do it. We will talk about how do you want your brand to be identified and positioned on the market, we'll talk about your competition and what you like/ dislike about their identities. We'll go over your competitors' websites (colors, positioning, functionality, UX). This would be a good time to decide on the domain name and reserve it in advance.
                                                        We'll profile your 4-5 most prolific (and different) customer types. Who are they, their interests, age , gender, social status, what services/ products are they getting from your business.

                                                        <strong>WHY ARE WE SPENDING TIME ON THIS:</strong> This session builds the foundation of how we will build/ refine your identity and the visual language of your brand. This will help me select the appropriate fonts, color palettes, element design and feel. We will analyze your competition in order to see how can we use some of the necessary trodden paths, but at the same time build a unique, unmatched experience. We will assemble customer profiles in order to understand the functionality the customers will need from your website and cater to it. An example user profile: Joe, 51 years old, hold a CEO position at a medium-sized oil company, recently divorced. He likes group atmosphere, he prefers a natural setting; his hobbies are fishing, hunting, etc.

                                                        <strong>GREAT, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME (THE CLIENT)?</strong> Research step does not produce an immediate benefit. However, a solid analysis provides the direction and reasoning for all of our future decisions. It frames the scope of the design and functionality of your website. Consider it as a first stage of an investment, when it is still to early to ask for a return.
                                                        Essentially, this session is all about understanding your clients' psychology. Why would you want to pick their brain? - In order to understand what is it they they need, what verbal and visual language they will relate to, how are they anticipating your products/ services be presented and what functionality are they expecting. Giving your clients something they anticipated will make them feel comfortable around your site and eager to explore your products/ services.
                                                        If you'd like to go deeper, we can even think about what some innovative features they did not anticipate. These features should serve to remove a set of actions in your customers' usual encounter with products and services similar to yours, and replace them with more intuitive and elegant actions. For example, instead of using a standard registration flow: "register now"-> fill and submit a form out-> open your email client-> wait for an email-> click the link->enter your credentials->click "sign in", many businesses have a login-via-a-social-network option. This results in only two clicks. Whereas customers were previuosly repelled by having to provide their time and remember yet another password, this simplifaction boosts the registration rates. Having such innovations would help the customers enjoy dealing with your company and make them want to come back again and agin, giving you the edge over your competitors.

                                                        <strong>BEFOREHAND:</strong>Based on the Basic UX session, I will create suggestions for your brand identity. This will include a multitude of goodies, such as: domain names, color palettes, typefaces, visual language vocabulary. User profiles will be assembled into user stories and user needs. Competitor's websites will be taken apart based on design, content, language, user experiences.

Best bits and pieces from the competitors' websites will be considered and the new, unique features defined.
                                                        This information will be used in a two-fold way: to identify the website type (and complexity/ budget associated with it) and to pick from the goodies (in Beforehand) to match the website FDO aspects. I will provide you with the reasoning and likely benefits/ consequences of each decision.

This will determine your website type (database-driven or static file) and give ground as to where should the all the elements be, how they should be phrased and designed.
                                                        Joe example continued (user needs and user story): He prefers an all-inclusive, top-notch service experience and money are not of concern. He clearly does not want to be concerned with small reservation/ contact details. He wants to get away from the tightness of the corporate atmosphere and be able to relax. That is evident by the contrast of his work and hobbies. He clearly needs a personalized, luxurious yet unpolished experience that is completely unlike his workplace. A user story will be defined as very simple, non-sophisticated

                                                        <strong>GREAT, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME (THE CLIENT)?</strong> Being able to determine your website type and functionality will give a better idea on the timing and the budget needed (for example, an eCommerse website will need more work than a simple landing page). Understanding your user needs will help me cater the FDO those particular needs. If the customers see what they like, they will stay longer (your search ranking goes up), they are more likely to scroll lower and read through and are more likely to contact you (generating sales!). This will also help you choose your marketing strategy, content and language (be it through Facebook, Google or other means).

                                                        <strong>BEFOREHAND:</strong>Now that we've settled on the FDO (website functionality, design and organizational aspects), I can prepare some hand-drawn wireframe sketches. They will be done for all the popular screen sizes- desktop/laptop, tablet and mobile. These are all done digitally- so the color schemes match, elements are easy to move around and updates are easily shareable with you. I will prepare these for all of the pages and menus.

                                                        <strong>WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT:</strong>This will be the fun session, as we'll have the first prototype to edit! We will adjust the colors, element positioning, element shape, font sizes, sitemap order and anything else that needs changing.  This sounds fun, but it will be enough work, as attention needs to be given to every page at minimum of 3 screen sizes. Besides, there are things that can be easily implemented in code, and there are things that are more complex (costing you more). Finally, some things will take so long to do programmatically, that they will need to be drawn out as vector art. Speaking of art, this is the time to consider where you'd want to get your photographs/ illustrations and copy/ editing services from. If you'd like it all to be done in-house, we will need to start ideating on what these will look like and where they will be positioned. You might want to devote a separate couple of sessions for this task as well. We will need to define and provide illustration sizes to the graphic designer and the amount of available space reserved for text to the copy specialist. We will work with these professionals continuously henceforth.

That's when we can go over the user design stories and put ourselves in the shoes of your customers. We will see what works and what does not work. The thing to keep in mind at this point is that these are hand-drawn sketches, so they would not look as professional and sleek as the vectorized and the coded version.

Read this as saving money by having less time devoted to initial iterations. Why would you want professional copy and illustration services? People make a decision within a first few 10's of seconds on whether they like something or not. And most of this attention is given to visual elements. This is why having quality illustrations is important. After the bait is taken, you want to follow up with a copy that talks in your customers' language, relates to notions familiar to them and parallels the design of your site. This is why you would want to have a carefully worded copy.

                                                        <strong>BEFOREHAND:</strong>The initial rough sketches will now be transformed into higher-resolution prototype, drawn as a vector image. Think of it as creating an ad-ready 3D render of a building before constructing it in real life. Before our Vectorizing Chat, I'll share (email, etc.) bits-and-pieces of higher-resolution website elements with you. This will be a way for you to provide your feedback on the elements and me to adjust them before I present you the whole thing. Illustrations and copy should be ready at this point and inserted into appropriate elements. The prototype will not be identical to the final version of your website- i.e. the elements will not be animated, there will not be complex graphical effects (ex: shadowing) and the buttons/ menus will not be clickable/ expandable. This is a conscious choice to have an output with a perfect cost-time-value balance. There are ways to make a fully functioning, clickable prototype at this point- but at RoarTheWeb, we believe it will provide you little benefit for too high of a cost.

At this point, all the final decisions on where all the elements are positioned, their shape and size should be made. This will be done for all the screen sizes, with written-out and settled-on breakpoints (screen sizes at which the layout changes- for example: a 1200px screen-width is when a desktop layout commonly changes to laptop). This is very important to think all of those points through. You might want to have a couple of days to think about/ look at our work and then have another session to make some changes. I urge you to do it simply because a vectorized draft is much easier (read: quicker & less expensive) to edit than a coded draft.

The difference being in that text is relatively easy to edit, but editing in code is much more time consuming. The caveat here is that there could be some discrepancy between an image and rendered code (due to specific rules regulating positioning of coded elements). We will do our best to account for these during the design problems, but just so you know- even the biggest and greatest design agencies run into this problem often enough.

I would like you to know that I will be using the best and most effective practiced on the web. For example: semantic classes, frameworks (reserved for most complex uses), inherent css grids and flexbox for layout and latest acessibility web standards. What this means to you is that if you'd like another web developer check out my work a while from now, he will deal with organized and easy-to understand code. This also means your site will be highly compatible with all of the future changes the web undergoes and will have support for people with disabilities. We would also have to be done any work on illustrations and copy, so the fit, typography and opacity can be adjusted. There could be small discrepancies between how elements were positioned in the vector prototype and in the code- that is a problem even with the most high-end design agencies. We will work through each case until you are completely satisfied. You are our #1 priority!

                                                        It is important for you to understand that if you'd like to alter some of the element shape/ size, positioning and breakpoints- it would be not easy to do it live in code. I will have to revert to the vector draft and perform these changes there during the chat. Afterwards, I'll complete the changes in code, and we will need to repeat our code session. This procedure will take time (and be more expensive), so it is best if we avoid it.

This couples tight to your sales and to what page Google/ Bing/ Yahoo lists you on.
                                                        Having a nicely designed site that is missing the final touches is like having a pair of expensive dress shoes, but not taking the time to shine them. There is very little effort that goes into this last step, but it has en enormous brand perception forming power. It would be just not worth it not to do it.

What was left out, however, is browser support and testing. The greatest headeache if web designers is that different browsers render the code differently. Moreover, different versions of the same browser can differ enourmously. If that's not enough, pitch in cross- OS differences. I will spend the time to fix and test the your website rendering for the most-used pallet of browsers. I will resample your images and minify the code as well. This is done to decrease the amount of data your users will spend when loading your page. Not everyone has unlimited and/ or snappy data plan on their mobile device. Decreasing the file sizes helps your users save and speeds up the loading time- raising your search engine ranking and lowering the chances of users closing your page due to long loading times. In case you site also runs Wordpress, I will install the best caching tools- they serve the same purpose.

In case you will be using Wordpress, you might need help installing and setting up different plugins. You might also want to consider getting a CMS editor, UX testing services, Google analytics set-up, social media setup and some ad services. This would be an optional session for talking over and deciding on your options.

However, in my experience, a first-time customer usually needs more guidance on how to improve different aspects of post-handover. In that case, we will fulfill the number of hours worked up to this point and then continue on with our arrangement. The extra services will help you be able to incorporate more advanced functionality into your site (blogs, eCommerce services, newsletter, form set-up), provide real-life information on how well does the site serve your user's needs (UX testing) and give you options on being able to edit your content without opening a code editor- should you need to modify any of it in the future.

                                                        <strong>GREAT, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME (THE CLIENT)?</strong>Being able to have advance services on your site will let you boost the customer engagement and interactivity. Such methods are widely renowned to grow sales. Being able to edit your content post-factum will provide you with functionality needed to do anything from phone number changes up to replacing outdated images with new ones. Having access to the ground-truth on how well certain site features work for your customers (by providing click heat-maps) will let us tweak the design in order to make the customers' eyes and mouseclicks land on where you'd want them to be- on sale-boosting call-to-action buttons!

                            Between RoarTheWeb (referred to as “We or Us”), a company solely owned by Stepan Lavrinenko.
                            And [full customer name] and [business name/ number] (referred to as "You").
                            <h5>Summary:</h5>
                            We’ll always do our best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. We’ve no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What we do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So in short;
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You agree to hire Us for the following services:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Design and build You a website. </b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <h5>What do both parties agree to?</h5>
                            <b>You:</b> You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You’ll give us the assets and information we tell you we need to complete the project. You’ll do this when we ask and provide it in the formats we ask for. You’ll review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Us:</b> We have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed with you and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We’ll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.
                            <h5>GETTING DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY</h5>
                            <b>Design</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We create look-and-feel designs, and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. We create designs iteratively and use this workflow for our website design process (sped up by filling the form located at roartheweb.com/quote).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You’ll have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback. We’ll either share a Dropbox, Google Drive folder or some other means of file storage to share our updates that is comfortable for you. We are open to utilize a number of messengers (Telegram, Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, Wire) - so you have options to choose from. Sms works too, but we won’t be able to share the files we need over it- so it will have to work in combination with a file-sharing service. Or we can just stick to the email.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We will have to utilize one of these services to hold the video chat sessions: Skype, Google Hangouts, Facetime or Wire. We can also meet in person (available in Calgary and periodically in Edmonton). Meeting in person gives me the right to charge you for the trip time calculated from the Dalhousie LRT train station via Google Maps, at a rate of $9/hr (driving a car). There is a 24-hour cancellation policy in effect: if you cancel (or move by more than 30 minutes) a session within 24-hours of the session start time, I will be charging you 1/2 of the session length we agreed on (with an $18 minimum charge). If you are late or would like to finish early, a 24-hour notice is required as well- otherwise a full session length is charged (from the time we agreed on for it to start until the time we agreed on for it to end). The time charges outlined here are included in calculating the point of the 10-hour increments (refer to the Financial section).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This is the rough schedule of the sessions. Each session can be split between multiple sessions if more time is needed:
                            <h5>Part 1: Branding and Basic UX:</h5>
                            <strong>BEFOREHAND:</strong> I'll receive a copy of the estimate form from you, and make a rough, minimum-hour estimate. I'll then ask you to proceed to complete a pre-payment (1/2 of the estimate). Following that, I'll do as much research into your business market, your brand and your customers as I can with the information provided. I will come up with some good search-friendly domain names and provide you with associated costs.
                            At the point when we reach 25, 50 and 75 hours of work, you will also be asked to fulfill the remaining balance. This is a standard industry practice and a measure of trust between you (as the client) and me as a designer/developer.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT:</strong> In case you have not provided me with any details on your business, now will be the time to do it. We will talk about how do you want your brand to be identified and positioned on the market, we'll talk about your competition and what you like/ dislike about their identities. We'll go over your competitors' websites (colors, positioning, functionality, UX). This would be a good time to decide on the domain name and reserve it in advance.
                            We'll profile your 4-5 most prolific (and different) customer types. Who are they, their interests, age , gender, social status, what services/ products are they getting from your business.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHY ARE WE SPENDING TIME ON THIS:</strong> This session builds the foundation of how we will build/ refine your identity and the visual language of your brand. This will help me select the appropriate fonts, color palettes, element design and feel. We will analyze your competition in order to see how can we use some of the necessary trodden paths, but at the same time build a unique, unmatched experience. We will assemble customer profiles in order to understand the functionality the customers will need from your website and cater to it. An example user profile: Joe, 51 years old, hold a CEO position at a medium-sized oil company, recently divorced. He likes group atmosphere, he prefers a natural setting; his hobbies are fishing, hunting, etc.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>GREAT, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME (THE CLIENT)?</strong> Research step does not produce an immediate benefit. However, a solid analysis provides the direction and reasoning for all of our future decisions. It frames the scope of the design and functionality of your website. Consider it as a first stage of an investment, when it is still to early to ask for a return.
                            Essentially, this session is all about understanding your clients' psychology. Why would you want to pick their brain? - In order to understand what is it they they need, what verbal and visual language they will relate to, how are they anticipating your products/ services be presented and what functionality are they expecting. Giving your clients something they anticipated will make them feel comfortable around your site and eager to explore your products/ services.
                            If you'd like to go deeper, we can even think about what some innovative features they did not anticipate. These features should serve to remove a set of actions in your customers' usual encounter with products and services similar to yours, and replace them with more intuitive and elegant actions. For example, instead of using a standard registration flow: "register now"-> fill and submit a form out-> open your email client-> wait for an email-> click the link->enter your credentials->click "sign in", many businesses have a login-via-a-social-network option. This results in only two clicks. Whereas customers were previuosly repelled by having to provide their time and remember yet another password, this simplifaction boosts the registration rates. Having such innovations would help the customers enjoy dealing with your company and make them want to come back again and agin, giving you the edge over your competitors.
                            <h5>Part 2: Branding and Advanced UX:</h5>
                            <strong>BEFOREHAND:</strong>Based on the Basic UX session, I will create suggestions for your brand identity. This will include a multitude of goodies, such as: domain names, color palettes, typefaces, visual language vocabulary. User profiles will be assembled into user stories and user needs. Competitor's websites will be taken apart based on design, content, language, user experiences.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT:</strong> The user stories and needs will be then converted into required website functionality, design and organizational aspects (FDO aspects). Best bits and pieces from the competitors' websites will be considered and the new, unique features defined.
                            This information will be used in a two-fold way: to identify the website type (and complexity/ budget associated with it) and to pick from the goodies (in Beforehand) to match the website FDO aspects. I will provide you with the reasoning and likely benefits/ consequences of each decision.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHY ARE WE SPENDING TIME ON THIS:</strong>At this point, we'll have your website looks and structure defined on paper. This will determine your website type (database-driven or static file) and give ground as to where should the all the elements be, how they should be phrased and designed.
                            Joe example continued (user needs and user story): He prefers an all-inclusive, top-notch service experience and money are not of concern. He clearly does not want to be concerned with small reservation/ contact details. He wants to get away from the tightness of the corporate atmosphere and be able to relax. That is evident by the contrast of his work and hobbies. He clearly needs a personalized, luxurious yet unpolished experience that is completely unlike his workplace. A user story will be defined as very simple, non-sophisticated
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>GREAT, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME (THE CLIENT)?</strong> Being able to determine your website type and functionality will give a better idea on the timing and the budget needed (for example, an eCommerse website will need more work than a simple landing page). Understanding your user needs will help me cater the FDO those particular needs. If the customers see what they like, they will stay longer (your search ranking goes up), they are more likely to scroll lower and read through and are more likely to contact you (generating sales!). This will also help you choose your marketing strategy, content and language (be it through Facebook, Google or other means).
                            <h5>Part 3: Sketching it out:</h5>
                            <strong>BEFOREHAND:</strong>Now that we've settled on the FDO (website functionality, design and organizational aspects), I can prepare some hand-drawn wireframe sketches. They will be done for all the popular screen sizes- desktop/laptop, tablet and mobile. These are all done digitally- so the color schemes match, elements are easy to move around and updates are easily shareable with you. I will prepare these for all of the pages and menus.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT:</strong>This will be the fun session, as we'll have the first prototype to edit! We will adjust the colors, element positioning, element shape, font sizes, sitemap order and anything else that needs changing.  This sounds fun, but it will be enough work, as attention needs to be given to every page at minimum of 3 screen sizes. Besides, there are things that can be easily implemented in code, and there are things that are more complex (costing you more). Finally, some things will take so long to do programmatically, that they will need to be drawn out as vector art. Speaking of art, this is the time to consider where you'd want to get your photographs/ illustrations and copy/ editing services from. If you'd like it all to be done in-house, we will need to start ideating on what these will look like and where they will be positioned. You might want to devote a separate couple of sessions for this task as well. We will need to define and provide illustration sizes to the graphic designer and the amount of available space reserved for text to the copy specialist. We will work with these professionals continuously henceforth.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHY ARE WE SPENDING TIME ON THIS:</strong>This is the point when words become digital elements and the design starts coming to life. That's when we can go over the user design stories and put ourselves in the shoes of your customers. We will see what works and what does not work. The thing to keep in mind at this point is that these are hand-drawn sketches, so they would not look as professional and sleek as the vectorized and the coded version.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>GREAT, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME (THE CLIENT)?</strong> Working with hand-drawn rough sketches is exactly what makes them so easily and quickly editable and speeds up the prototyping process. Read this as saving money by having less time devoted to initial iterations. Why would you want professional copy and illustration services? People make a decision within a first few 10's of seconds on whether they like something or not. And most of this attention is given to visual elements. This is why having quality illustrations is important. After the bait is taken, you want to follow up with a copy that talks in your customers' language, relates to notions familiar to them and parallels the design of your site. This is why you would want to have a carefully worded copy.
                            <h5>Part 4: Wireframe prototype:</h5>
                            <strong>BEFOREHAND:</strong>The initial rough sketches will now be transformed into higher-resolution prototype, drawn as a vector image. Think of it as creating an ad-ready 3D render of a building before constructing it in real life. Before our Vectorizing Chat, I'll share (email, etc.) bits-and-pieces of higher-resolution website elements with you. This will be a way for you to provide your feedback on the elements and me to adjust them before I present you the whole thing. Illustrations and copy should be ready at this point and inserted into appropriate elements. The prototype will not be identical to the final version of your website- i.e. the elements will not be animated, there will not be complex graphical effects (ex: shadowing) and the buttons/ menus will not be clickable/ expandable. This is a conscious choice to have an output with a perfect cost-time-value balance. There are ways to make a fully functioning, clickable prototype at this point- but at RoarTheWeb, we believe it will provide you little benefit for too high of a cost.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT:</strong>We will look through the higher-resolution website to see if everything looks the way it was planned to. At this point, all the final decisions on where all the elements are positioned, their shape and size should be made. This will be done for all the screen sizes, with written-out and settled-on breakpoints (screen sizes at which the layout changes- for example: a 1200px screen-width is when a desktop layout commonly changes to laptop). This is very important to think all of those points through. You might want to have a couple of days to think about/ look at our work and then have another session to make some changes. I urge you to do it simply because a vectorized draft is much easier (read: quicker & less expensive) to edit than a coded draft.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHY ARE WE SPENDING TIME ON THIS:</strong>Think of it as the last draft before producing a final, ready-to-be-submitted copy of an article. The difference being in that text is relatively easy to edit, but editing in code is much more time consuming. The caveat here is that there could be some discrepancy between an image and rendered code (due to specific rules regulating positioning of coded elements). We will do our best to account for these during the design problems, but just so you know- even the biggest and greatest design agencies run into this problem often enough.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>GREAT, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME (THE CLIENT)?</strong> It is simply more cost-effective to make changes in an easily editable media (vector image) than in code. We are constantly looking for ways to save your time (get you up and running) and money (yay! 😊 ).
                            <h5>Part 5: Code: Putting on makeup:</h5>
                            <strong>BEFOREHAND:</strong> Now that we have built a highly detailed vector image prototype, it will all be converted to code. I would like you to know that I will be using the best and most effective practiced on the web. For example: semantic classes, frameworks (reserved for most complex uses), inherent css grids and flexbox for layout and latest acessibility web standards. What this means to you is that if you'd like another web developer check out my work a while from now, he will deal with organized and easy-to understand code. This also means your site will be highly compatible with all of the future changes the web undergoes and will have support for people with disabilities. We would also have to be done any work on illustrations and copy, so the fit, typography and opacity can be adjusted. There could be small discrepancies between how elements were positioned in the vector prototype and in the code- that is a problem even with the most high-end design agencies. We will work through each case until you are completely satisfied. You are our #1 priority!
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT:</strong>We will adjust small details such as shadowing, opacities, tweak colors and polish the animations. In so many words, some fancy makeup and light touchups to make it look its best.
                            It is important for you to understand that if you'd like to alter some of the element shape/ size, positioning and breakpoints- it would be not easy to do it live in code. I will have to revert to the vector draft and perform these changes there during the chat. Afterwards, I'll complete the changes in code, and we will need to repeat our code session. This procedure will take time (and be more expensive), so it is best if we avoid it.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHY ARE WE SPENDING TIME ON THIS:</strong> This is where we will make sure that all the small details that we've been skipping over before will come into the spotlight. Small things like the speed of the fade-ins, opacity levels of the pop-ups, etc. can play a major role in how emotionally connected a user will feel to your website.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>GREAT, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME (THE CLIENT)?</strong> User empathy translates directly on whether a user clicks a button or not, and on how much time is spent on the page. This couples tight to your sales and to what page Google/ Bing/ Yahoo lists you on.
                            Having a nicely designed site that is missing the final touches is like having a pair of expensive dress shoes, but not taking the time to shine them. There is very little effort that goes into this last step, but it has en enormous brand perception forming power. It would be just not worth it not to do it.
                            <h5>Part 6: Post-production help:</h5>
                            <strong>BEFOREHAND:</strong> At this point, the code is edited to how it should look like- all screen sizes and all. What was left out, however, is browser support and testing. The greatest headeache if web designers is that different browsers render the code differently. Moreover, different versions of the same browser can differ enourmously. If that's not enough, pitch in cross- OS differences. I will spend the time to fix and test the your website rendering for the most-used pallet of browsers. I will resample your images and minify the code as well. This is done to decrease the amount of data your users will spend when loading your page. Not everyone has unlimited and/ or snappy data plan on their mobile device. Decreasing the file sizes helps your users save and speeds up the loading time- raising your search engine ranking and lowering the chances of users closing your page due to long loading times. In case you site also runs Wordpress, I will install the best caching tools- they serve the same purpose.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT:</strong> At this point, the website is ready to be handed off. However, there are certain things that you might need additional help with, such as uploading it to your webhost of choice. In case you will be using Wordpress, you might need help installing and setting up different plugins. You might also want to consider getting a CMS editor, UX testing services, Google analytics set-up, social media setup and some ad services. This would be an optional session for talking over and deciding on your options.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>WHY ARE WE SPENDING TIME ON THIS:</strong>My deliverables will consist off .html/ .css/ .js files and images, or in Wordpress/ other applicable services login information. f you are well versed in what has to be done after the handover, there is no point for you to spend more time/ budget on these extra services. However, in my experience, a first-time customer usually needs more guidance on how to improve different aspects of post-handover. In that case, we will fulfill the number of hours worked up to this point and then continue on with our arrangement. The extra services will help you be able to incorporate more advanced functionality into your site (blogs, eCommerce services, newsletter, form set-up), provide real-life information on how well does the site serve your user's needs (UX testing) and give you options on being able to edit your content without opening a code editor- should you need to modify any of it in the future.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>GREAT, BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME (THE CLIENT)?</strong>Being able to have advance services on your site will let you boost the customer engagement and interactivity. Such methods are widely renowned to grow sales. Being able to edit your content post-factum will provide you with functionality needed to do anything from phone number changes up to replacing outdated images with new ones. Having access to the ground-truth on how well certain site features work for your customers (by providing click heat-maps) will let us tweak the design in order to make the customers' eyes and mouseclicks land on where you'd want them to be- on sale-boosting call-to-action buttons!
                            If, at any stage, you change your mind about what you want to be delivered and are not happy with the direction our work is taking you’ll pay us in full for the time we’ve spent working with you until that point and terminate this contract. The work we do has a value on its own and the amount of time that was spent on it has to be compensated according to the mechanisms in this contract.
                            <h5>Text content</h5>
                            Unless agreed separately, we’re not responsible for inputting text or images into your content management system or creating every page on your website. We provide professional copywriting and editing services, so if you’d like us to create new content or input content for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.
                            <h5>Graphics and photographs</h5>
                            You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries. If you’d like us to search for photographs for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We have a graphic designer in-house. She can provide you with additional services in creating any illustrations you’ll require or editing/ touching up your photographs. This will need to be accounted for in terms of additional sessions (and time). She will be charging you our standard rate and it will all be included in a single invoice.
                            <h5>HTML, CSS and JavaScript deliverables</h5>
                            We deliver web page types developed from HTML markup, CSS stylesheets for styling and JS for advanced functionality.
                            <h5>Browser testing</h5>
                            Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. We’ll also test to ensure that people who use Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 for Windows get an appropriate experience. We won’t test in other older browsers unless we agreed separately. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.
                            <h5>Mobile browser testing</h5>
                            Mobile browser testing Testing using popular smaller screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. We will test the website on Chrome running on Android and Safari running on iOS emulator.We won’t test in Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, specific Android devices, Windows or other mobile browsers unless we agreed separately. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a separate estimate for that.
                            <h5>Technical support</h5>
                            We’re not a website hosting company so we don’t offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don’t, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred hosting providers. We can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software (such as Google Analytics) and UX analysis software and we can provide a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will be up to you.
                            <h5>Search engine optimisation (SEO)</h5>
                            We will follow the accessibility guidelines, minify our code and include differently sampled images for different viewport sizes in order to help your ranking. We can help you with generating sitemaps and anything else as well. However, we cannot guarantee tangible and immediate improvements to your website’s search engine ranking, but the web pages that we develop are accessible to search engines.
                            <h5>Changes and revisions</h5>
                            We don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the number of weeks that we estimate we’ll need to accomplish everything you’ve told us you want to achieve, but we’re happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as we’ll provide a separate estimate for those additional weeks.
                            <h5>Legal stuff</h5>
                            We’ll carry out our work in accordance with good industry practice and at the standard expected from a suitably qualified person with relevant experience.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            That said, we can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Your liability to us will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under this contract and you won’t be liable to us or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if we’ve advised you of them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Phew.

                            <br>
                            You’ll own the website we design for you plus the visual elements that we create for it. We’ll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we’re not required to keep a copy. You own all intellectual property rights of text, images, site specification and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We’ll own any intellectual property rights we’ve developed prior to, or developed separately from this project and not paid for by you. We’ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and we’ll license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.
                            <h5>Displaying our work</h5>
                            We love to show off our work, so we reserve the right to display all aspects of our creative work, including sketches, work-in-progress designs and the completed project on our portfolio and in articles on websites, in magazine articles and in books.
                            <h5>Payment details:</h5>
                            You will be charged at $18/hr (invoiced) or $16/hr (paid in cash with no invoice provided) for our services. You will be provided with the minimum-hour estimate over  email. You will be responsible to fulfill 1/2 of the estimate before the work is started. After 20, 30, 40 (and consecutive increments of 10 hours) hours of work the total outstanding balance needs to be fulfilled by You. You will be provided with a report outlining how many hours per each day were spent before each of those payments.
                            <br>

                            For example: An initial minimum-hour estimate is $400. A pre-payment of $200 is paid out by You to RoarTheWeb before the work commences. The working hours are timed, and when the total worked hours approach 20 hours, amount worked is calculated: 20 hours*$18/hr= 360. Since a pre-payment of $200 has been completed previously, the total amount owing is: (amount worked) - (pre-payment) =$360-$200= $160. This is the amount that needs to be compensated by You to RoarTheWeb. In case the amount owing is negative (i.e. amount worked is less than the pre-payment), no payment is required at that moment. However, the amount owing is recalculated and compensated at the next 10 hour increment again.

                            <br>
                            When we mutually agree that the work has been completed, you are required to submit any outstanding amount up to that point in time. Only after the final amount owing, as per our final invoice, is received by us we will provide you with the files or login/passwords (in case we are working on a wordpress or other hosted website content management environment). Prior to that, we are free to change such logins/ passwords without providing you the details. Prior to that, we are exempt from sharing html/css/javascript files with you. You receive the intellectual property right only on the completion of the final payment as well.
                            <h5>Payment schedule:</h5>
                            We issue invoices electronically. Our payment terms are 3 days from the date of invoice by BACS or the SWIFT international payments system. All proposals are quoted in CAD dollars and payments will be made at the equivalent conversion rate at the date the transfer is made.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You agree to pay all charges associated with international transfers of funds. The appropriate bank account details will be printed on our electronic invoice. We reserve the right to charge interest on all overdue debts at the rate of 10%  per month or part of a month.
                            <b>But where’s all the horrible small print?</b>
                            Just like a parking ticket, neither of us can transfer this contract to anyone else without the other’s permission.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We both agree that we’ll adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in relation to our activities under this contract and not cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.

                            This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.
