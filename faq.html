Well, perhaps- when they are beside each other, but not in the browser's address bar. The first one is a fake Google domain, and the second one is real. The letter "ɢ" (unicode 0262), also called a "small capital latin g" was used by a Russian spammer Vitaliy Popov for massive identity theft of people believing they are in official correspondence with Google. Google- with its massive resources and armies of lawyers, hadn't thought of purchasing the domain ɢoogle.com. We should learn from the mistakes of the giants.
